              Yes! If you're looking for a free calorie counter app, you're in
              the right place. Simply sign up for your free account here and
              start tracking your food. The MyFitnessPal app does a lot more
              than track calories in foods. You can also track macros, vitamins,
              and other micronutrients and see how everything you eat supports
              your goals. Want to level up your goals? Upgrade to Premium!
              Unlock MyFitnessPal's best tools (like Barcode Scan, Intermittent
              Fasting, and Custom Macro Goals). If you've never upgraded to
              MyFitnessPal Premium or never started a Premium trial before, you
              are eligible for a 1-month free trial. Start your free trial now.
              The first Premium subscription charge on your credit card will be
              after the trial. Once the trial ends, your subscription will
              auto-renew unless you cancel. If you purchased a monthly
              subscription, you will be charged every month. If you purchased an
              annual subscription, you will be charged every year. You may
              cancel your recurring subscription at any time. Cancel at least 24
              hours before the next renewal date to avoid being charged for the
              upcoming billing cycle. When you cancel, you are canceling the
              next billing charge—Premium features will remain available to you
              until the end of your current paid subscription period, regardless
              of when you cancel the automatic renewal.

              how many calories you eat each day, the MyFitnessPal app makes it
              easy. Sign up for a free account and download the app. Then you
              can quickly look up calories and nutrients for any food AND track
              it all to see the impact of food on your health and fitness goals.
              Free members can do a simple food search from their app's home
              screen. Premium members have access to other time-saving tools
              that allow you to scan a barcode or individual foods with your
              phone's camera to instantly identify the best match. Learn more
              about Premium and try it free. However you choose to look up
              calories for foods, MyFitnessPal gives you access to over 18
              million global foods in one of the world's largest food databases
              — including fresh foods, packaged goods, restaurant items, and
              even foods and recipes you save yourself.

              MyFitnessPal isn't just a calorie tracking app. We're a macro
              tracking app, a micronutrient tracking app, and a water tracking
              app — all in one! (Not to mention the other goals you can track,
              including weight, exercise, steps, and intermittent fasting.)
              Simply log the foods you eat using one of our easy food tracking
              tools, and we'll show you a complete nutritional breakdown for
              each food, meal, day, and even week. Any way you want to look at
              your data, you'll gain a better understanding of your personal
              nutrition so you can make smart choices that align with your
              weight, health, and fitness goals.

            <p>
              Yes, MyFitnessPal uses a BMR calculator to help you set calorie
              goals. During signup, you'll be asked questions about your height,
              weight, age, and sex to estimate your BMR (basal metabolic rate).
              You can also estimate your own BMR with our BMR calculator. The
              equation used to calculate BMR is called the Mifflin St. Jeor
              equation* and it takes into account your typical activity level
              during the day to calculate your daily calorie needs. Depending on
              your weight goals, we either add or subtract calories from your
              daily calorie needs (500 calories per pound of weight change per
              week desired). To help you set safe weight goals during signup, we
              use a BMI calculator. BMI is based on the ratio of your weight to
              your height, and we don't allow you to set weight goals below a
              certain ratio. *The Mifflin St. Jeor equation is considered to be
              the best estimation of calorie needs compared to other equations,
              being able to get within 10% of your actual energy needs on
              average.

              Yes! The best thing about MyFitnessPal is that it's an all-in-one
              app. You don't need a separate intermittent fasting app, or
              different apps for water tracking, weight tracking, or fitness
              tracking. All MyFitnessPal members can track their weight goals,
              exercise, and water intake alongside calories and nutrition.
              MyFitnessPal Premium members have many additional features,
